Tests can either be executed as part of the ordinary maven build (unless -Dmaven.test.skip=true is added as an argument, maven will always run tests),
or the tests can be run from inside your IDE environment.

Most of the tests are ordinary junit tests, and can run without any special setup.

The tests found in LoginTests.java, requires the following to be able to run

* the IdP project must be running
* the /etc/hosts file (or windows equivalent) must contain idp/sp entries
* Chrome version 78 or higher must be installed on the machine

The IdP project found in the OIOSAML source repository can be started like this

$ mvn clean install spring-boot:run

the following two entries must be added to the hosts file, to ensure that the SAML metadata found in the test-cases will work

127.0.0.1 sp
127.0.0.1 idp

and the chromedriver binary found in the /bin/ folder must match the installed version of Chrome on the machine. The default chromedriver
is a 64-bit linux binary, that works with Chrome 78 or better. It is possible to download other chromedrivers here
